                    What is Paper Wastage?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We use paper in our daily lives. From writing an exam, to using a notebook for homework, we use paper everyday. 
                    However, as more people use paper, the consumption of paper starts to increase more and more. Because of this, the amount 
                    of trees being cut down is overtaking the amount of trees being planted. This raises issues as trees provide many benefits for 
                    the environment around us and other animals in that habitat. Unfortunately, paper is being thrown out and misused by humans. 
                    Paper ends up in the landfill which causes many problems and people are throwing more paper everyday, without a valid reason. 
                    Creating posters, writing exams, doing homework on paper, and more are all examples. This is called paper wastage and this issue 
                    needs more attention more than ever.
