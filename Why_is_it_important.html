                    Paper wastage is a very important issue that is being over looked. It is a very important issue as it 
                    can lead to many issues including global warming, rise in sea levels, and many more. Since trees are the main 
                    source of how paper is made, many trees are being cut down in order to make paper. However because of this, the 
                    rate in which trees grow is being overtaken by the rate of amount of trees we are cutting. This is a huge issue 
                    because it is a leading cause of climate change as there isnâ€™t enough trees in order to reduce the amount of carbon 
                    in the air. Which is having a severe impacts on many places like Australia with their wildfire, amazon rainforest and 
                    their forest fire, and many more issues.
