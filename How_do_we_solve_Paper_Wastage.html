                <h1>How do we solve Paper Wastage?</h1>
                <p>There are many ways that we can solve paper wastage. For starters, you can change your lifestyle to use minimal paper. You could 
                    try to use alternatives instead of paper which can dramatically reduce the amount of paper that you consume. Examples of alternatives 
                    can include emails, recycled paper, text messages, and many other source of digital communications. Another option is by unsubscribing to 
                    any unnecessary subscriptions which you don't use in your daily lives. This can cut down your consumption of paper dramatically and can even save 
                    you some money if you rarely see these subscriptions. Another way you can reduce paper wastage is by using alternative source of paper rather than 
                    using paper from wood. There are many types of paper which are manufactured everywhere. Alternative sources of paper source can include bamboo paper, 
                    argi-pulp paper, and many more. They provide the same properties of paper and can save lots of trees and save lots of energy to cut the trees down.
